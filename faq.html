              What is Wekka?
Why should I use Wekka?
What kind of employees can I find using Wekka?
How much does it cost?
NOTHING. All features of Wekka are currently free.
              In which countries can I use Wekka?
Wekka is currently based and supported in Israel. For relocation offers from Israel, select Relocation in the Locations Form.
              here was an technical issue, what should I do?
// In the bottom right corner of each page there is a feedback button. Select it and fill in your issue with as much detail as possible. You can fill in your email to be notified as soon as your issue is resolved. 

Otherwise email support@wekka.co outlining your concern. A member of our team will get back to you as soon as possible.
I got an email notification but when I logged in there was nothing new!
Email notifications are based on real time changes in the Wekka system. As soon as there is a change you will be notified. Sometimes, when changes happen quickly, you can be notified but not be able to see a change.
For example: if a Candidate accepts your CV request, but before you log back in closes their account - possibly due to finding another job - that candidate’s CV will not show up on your Match Screen.
This happens very rarely so you don’t worry about it. Wekka gets new job seekers all the time, so you should not need to wait long until finding more perfect matches.

              What is the skills form?
In the skills form, you will select the relevant required skills for your job offering.
If your job can be done by someone with any skills, select any.

After selecting a skill, the experience slider will be revealed. You can slide this to indicate how many years of experience is required in this particular skill. The experience time starts at 0 years (Meaning no experience) and goes to 10 years.

Note: more than one skill can be selected
//You can select upto 7 relevant skills.
Why is the skill that I need not on the skills form?
If the skill you need is not on the skills form, simply scroll to the bottom of the form and select Add a Skill. 
A screen will pop up where you can suggest the new skill. This skill will be reviewed and if approved, added to the list. Leave your email address and we’ll update you when it’s added.
What is the salary form?
In the salary form you will select the maximum salary you are willing to pay, per hour, for the job on offer. This is done by sliding the salary slider. Salaries range from 0-100 NIS per hour.
For sales or similar target-based jobs, you can indicate that there is additional commission above this base salary. You can indicate this by selecting Add Commission.
For jobs that do not have a base salary, and are totally based on commission, you can select Solely Commission.
What is the Locations form?
In the Locations Form you can select the location(s) of your office/place of work. For jobs that can be done in any location, you can select Any. For jobs done remotely, you can select Work From Home.
//What is difference from any and work from home?

Note: more than one Location can be selected
What is the education form?
In the education form you select the required education level for the job on offer. Education levels range from High-School Diploma to Doctorate. If there is no minimum level, simply select Any.

Note: only one education level can be selected
What is the languages form?
In the Languages Form you can select the necessary languages for the job on offer. On selecting a Language, a fluency slider will appear. On the fluency slider you can select the level of fluency needed in the language. Fluency ranges from Basic to Fluent.

Jobs requiring English, Hebrew, Spanish, German, Russian, French, Dutch and/or Arabic can be created.

Note: more than one Language can be selected
What is the Job-Type form?
In the Job-Type form you will be able to select the type of job you have available. You are able to indicate whether the open position requires a Full time, part-time or temporary/contract commitment. Internship positions can also be offered.
If you are looking for an employee willing to work in any of the above fashions, select Any.

Note: more than one Job-Type can be selected
What is the Shifts form?
In the Shifts form you will be able to choose at what time of day the work will be done. The options are Morning, Afternoon and Night, and any combination of those can be selected. If no particular shift is required, select Any.

What is the Work Days form?
In the Work Days form you can select the days of the week required for the position. Any combination of days can be selected. If specific days are not needed, select Any.
What is Job title?
The Job Title is the official name of open position on offer.
What is Job Description?
The Job Description is a more detailed explanation of the open position. Ideally this will include the general activities required from an employee in this position. Additionally, it is best to also include information about the company as a whole and the general work environment.
Who sees my open position?
When you complete filling in the Job Forms and // confirm your email address, you will be taken to a screen of potential candidates for your position. At this screen you will see all the matches and a short Bio of each potential candidate. If, after seeing their matched characteristics and bio you would like to make contact with them, you can send a CV request. Only upon sending a CV request will a candidate be able to see your job offer.

This means you are in control of who sees your offer, ensuring only candidates in whom you are interested will be able to send you their CV’s. No more irrelevant or spam CV’s.
Can everyone see my Job Post?
No, only after you have sent a CV request to a specific candidate will they be able to see your job details. This includes the job criteria (with salary undisclosed), Job Title and Job Description.
In this way, you are in total control of who is able to send you a CV and apply for the job. Say goodbye to undesired job applications.
How long do I wait to see Potential Candidates?
As soon as you have completed the Job Form and // confirmed your email address, you will be redirected to a screen of matched candidates. From here you can send a request for the CV of each appealing candidate.
As there are always new candidates being added to the system, you can expect that more matches will be made over time. You will get an email with updates of any new matches.
If you feel you do not have enough matched candidates, perhaps go back and edit your job criteria. As the matching is done very precisely, small changes can have large effects. Perhaps increase salary by a few shekels extra an hour?

// Note: Be certain before making any changes, you will only be able to make one change per day.
I forgot my Password!
//
I have no matches, what now?
Having no matches normally means your job is very specialised. If possible, edit your job criteria to give you more possible matches. We generally suggest to increase salary, or lower experience needed.
If you still do not have any matches, don’t panic - we have new job seekers added to the system all the time. You’ll be sent an email notification as soon as a match is found.
Why am I not getting matches?
This may be because you have made some of the job criteria too specialised or too high (or too low, in the case of salary). Consider editing your job profile to open you up to more possible matches.
If after editing you still don’t have any matches, you may just need to give it some time. Wekka is always getting new Job Seekers, and as soon as matches are found, you’ll be notified via email.
What does Perfect match mean?
Potential Candidates have 4 ranks: Perfect, Great, Good and Weak. A perfect match means that every one of the requirements of your open position have been matched 100%.
These are the most ideal candidates to send a CV request.
What does Great match mean?
Great is the second best type of match. A great match means that almost every one of the requirements for your open position are met. When viewing the candidate’s details, the section not met perfectly will have a coloured border. If, after viewing the details that did not perfectly match, you are still interested in the candidate you can send them a CV request. 
If you are not interested in this candidate, click ignore. This will send them to the // trash. All hidden matches can be seen by selecting // Trash .
What does Good match mean?
A good match means there is strong overlap between the candidate and your job criteria, but it is not a perfect match. You can see which areas the candidate does not match with your job criteria by viewing their details.// The areas that do not perfectly match will have a coloured border. If you are still interested in hiring this candidate, select Send CV Request.
Click ignore if you are not interested in the candidate. They can be seen later in // Trash .

What does Weak match mean?
Weak is the lowest of the 4 ranks: Perfect, Great, Good and Weak. A weak match means that while still largely overlapping with the job criteria, the candidate does not match perfectly to many areas. These non-matched areas will have a coloured border when selecting to View Details. If, despite the non-matched areas, you are still interesting in interviewing the candidate, send him a CV request. Otherwise select ignore to send the candidate to Trash.
You can see this candidate later by opening the Trash.

Why can’t I see a candidate’s name?
Job Seekers may prefer not to reveal their name while searching for a new job. For this reason they can opt to keep their name hidden. You can still send these candidates a CV Request. If accepted, the candidates name and other details will be available for view
What is a CV request?
A CV request should be sent if you have seen the matched criteria and Bio of a matched job seeker, and you may want to set up an interview. The selected job seeker will then be notified that you would like to see their CV. At this stage, the Job Seeker can review the job title, description and criteria, and if interested they will accept the request.
Once a request has been accepted you will be notified and will be able to download their CV. Further actions after this (correspondence, setting up an interview, training etc) are not done using Wekka.
I’ve sent a CV request, now what?
A CV request will notify the chosen Job Seeker that you would like to see their CV and details. They will then be able to view the matched job specifics (Skills and experience, location, education required, languages and language levels, job type, shifts needed and work days). They will not be able to see the numeric hourly salary, only that it has been matched. They will also be able to see the job title and description.
If they want to apply for the job, they will accept the request. This will allow you to see their details and download their CV. If they do not want to apply for the job, they will decline the request. // You will be notified of any new actions taken by job seekers when you log in.
If you have not had a response within 3 days, you will be able to Ping the candidate. This will notify them that you are still awaiting a response.
How will I know if a candidate has accepted my CV Request?
// If a candidate has accepted your CV request they you will be notified by a popup as soon as you log in. Their profile will also move into the match section called CVs Received. From there you will be able to download their CV.
How will I know if a candidate has declined  my CV Request?
// If a candidate has declined your CV request, you will be notified by a popup as soon as you log in. Their profile will also move into the match section called Declined Requests. You will no longer be able to contact this job seeker.

What does the candidate see?
You are in control of who sees your open position. You can allow certain job seekers to see the specifics of your job by sending them a CV Request. If a CV Request has been sent to a candidate, they will be able to see the required skills and experience, location, education, languages and language levels, job type, shifts and work days. The candidate will not be able to see the salary amount you have entered - they will know only that it matches their salary requirement. 
What does Ignore mean?
Ignore should be selected for candidates that you are not interested in interviewing. These can be could later in Trash.
What are Hidden Matches//Trash?
Trash is the collection of all matches for which you selected Ignore. //You can move them back to the Matches Section by selecting //
What is a Ping?
A Ping is a follow up notification to a job seeker and can be sent to a candidate only 72 hours after sending a CV request. QQQ It let’s the job seeker know that you are still interested in receiving their CV, and that you are awaiting a response to your CV Request.

Note: A Ping can only be sent if a CV Request has neither been accepted nor denied
I’ve sent a ping, now what?
A Ping notifies a job seeker that you are still interested in receiving their CV, and prompts them to respond. It can be sent 3 days after sending them a CV request. 
After sending a Ping you will need to wait until the job seeker either accepts or declines the CV Request.
Why is the candidate not responding?
A candidate may not have responded due to simply not having checked their notifications, or they may have seen your offer and not been interested in the job.
Try sending a Ping to any candidates who do not respond to your initial CV Request. If they still do not respond, focus on your other matches. Remember: Wekka gets new job seekers all the time - fresh matches are around the corner.
I’ve got a CV, now what?
//
How do I change the Job Characteristics/Requirements?
//
What does ‘Report’ mean?
The report function should be used to flag Candidate profiles that are suspicious or inconsistent in some way. This candidate will then be reviewed, and if appropriate, removed from the system.
What does Close Job mean?
Close Job will close your open position. This is done when you are no longer looking for candidates - either the position is filled, or is no longer relevant. After closing a job, you will no longer be able to interact with matches for that job.
Do I need to close my job?
Yes, when a job if filled or no longer relevant you will need to close the job. This will notify candidates with Pending CV Requests or who have sent you their CVs.
Without closing a job you will still get matches and notifications for the position.

              What is the skills form?
The skills form is where you select the skills you have or want to use in the job you’re after. You can select any combination of these. 
When you select a skill there is an experience slider that will drop down. It is set at 0 years experience, slide it from left to right if you have experience in that field. The jobs you will be matched to will match some or all of the skills you have selected.
Why is the skill that I want not on the skills form?
We have put together a collection of the most popular skills out there. If you think we missed something, scroll to the bottom of the skills and select Add a Skill. Suggest your skill and it will be reviewed. Leave your email address to be notified as soon as it’s added.
What is the salary form?
The Salary form is where you select the minimum salary you are willing to consider working for. Set this as low as you are comfortable to consider to open you up to more matches. Remember: You will be matched to jobs according to this criteria, to avoiding wasting your own and employer’s time be sure not to put this unreasonably high or low.
What is the Locations form?
The locations form is where you select the areas you are willing to work in. Wekka offers you to choose to work in the Merkaz, Haifa, Jerusalem, the Negev, the North and the West Bank. 
If you are looking for a work from home job, select Work-from-home. If you’re looking for something abroad select Relocation.
You can select Any if you are looking for work anywhere.

Remember: You can select as many options as you wish. Don’t waste your and employers’ time by selecting places you would never work in.
What is the education form?
The education form is where you input your highest level of education. If you do not have any formal education, select None. // if student...


What is the languages form?
The languages form is where you select the languages that you speak at at which level you speak them. The Languages include English, Hebrew, Spanish, German, Russian, French, Dutch and Arabic. You can select from 4 levels of fluency of each : Basic, Intermediate, Advanced and Fluent.
Remember: You are going to be matched to jobs based on this criteria. Don’t add that you speak a language better than you really do.
What is the Job-Type form?
The Job-Type form is where you select the kind of job you are interested in. Wekka allows you to find Full-Time, Part-Time, Contract/Temporary and Internship positions. 
Be sure to select only the type of work you are interested in.
What is the Shifts form?
The shifts form is where you select the time(s) of day you would like to work. You can select Morning, Afternoon and/or Night. Select Any if you are available for shifts at any time.
Remember: You can select any combination of times. Don’t say you are willing to work at times you do not want to.
What is the Work Days form?
The Work Days form is where you select the days you are available to work on. You can select a specific combination of days, or you can select Any if you have no preference. If you do not work on Saturdays, make sure to select all the individual days Sunday - Friday, not Any.

What if I don’t have a CV?
//Don’t worry! Leave your phone number and Bio and you can apply with that.
Can anyone see my details?
Once you have have completed your profile, it will be run through our system and matches to open jobs will be made. The employers of only the matched open jobs will be able to see your matching characteristics, name (if not hidden) and Bio. If they want to see your CV, they will need to send you a CV Request. Only If you accept the request will they be able to see your CV and personal details.
Where Does my CV go?
Your CV is stored securely on the Wekka system. Only if you accept a CV Request will an Employer be able to download and view it. You have the control.
Who sees my CV?
If an Employer sees your profile and wants to see your CV, they will send you a CV request. Only if you accept this request will they be able to download and view your CV.
A CV request will show you the Job Title, description, and matched characteristics of a particular job. If you are interested in this job, simply accept the request.
What is a Bio?
A Bio is a short personal description. You may want to include what makes you special or stand out from other candidates, or show a little personality. This will be seen by potential Employers, and will hopefully convince them to ask for your CV.
What does hiding name mean?
If you would prefer Employers not to see your name when reviewing matches, select // ‘hide name’. Employers will then only be able to see your matched criteria and Bio. If you accept a CV request from the Employer, they will then be able to see your name.

I forgot my Password!
//
I got an email notification but when I logged in there was nothing new!
Wekka let’s you know on email when something new happens. Sometimes, if you do not check straight away, things can change. //You should see a notification of what it was on login
How long must I wait until I get a job offer?
This can vary widely depending on your field and other requirements. If you do not receive an offer within a week of making your profile, perhaps consider editing it to allow for more matches. Try making it a little broader, and perhaps ask for a slightly lower salary - small changes can impact matches greatly.
Remember: Only make changes that are factual, and that if matched you would consider the job.
I filled everything in, now what?
Now you can go back to your everyday life. Check Facebook, watch movies, read… Let Wekka do the work. You’ll get notified via email as soon as there is a request for your CV.
If you want some ideas of what to do, visit our Expand page.
What is a CV request?
When an Employer has a job that has matched your personal criteria, they will see you as a match. They will be able to see your name, bio and  matched characteristics to compare to their open position. They will not be able to see the value you selected for salary.
If they believe you may be a good fit, they will send a request to you to see your CV. If you accept, they will be able to view and download your CV.
